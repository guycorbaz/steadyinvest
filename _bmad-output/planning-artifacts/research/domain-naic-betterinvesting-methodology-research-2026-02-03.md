## Research Overview

This domain research focuses on the **BetterInvesting (NAIC) Methodology**, specifically the **Stock Selection Guide (SSG)**, to establish a robust foundation for an internationalized investment analysis application.

### Proposed Research Scope

1. **Fundamental Principles**: Core tenets of BetterInvesting (regular investing, dividend reinvestment, growth focus).
2. **SSG Technical Logic**:
    - Visual trend analysis (logarithmic charting).
    - Quality metrics (PTP, ROE, Debt).
    - Valuation logic (PE ranges, Upside/Downside ratios).
3. **Internationalization Challenges**: Adapting US-centric models to European accounting (IFRS) and multi-currency contexts.
4. **Portfolio Strategy**: The "Rule of Five" and diversification standards.
