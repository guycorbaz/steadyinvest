## 1. Document Inventory

The following documents have been discovered and inventoried for this assessment:

### PRD Documents Found

- [product-brief-naic-2026-02-03.md](file:///home/gcorbaz/synology/devel/naic/_bmad-output/planning-artifacts/product-brief-naic-2026-02-03.md) (8.5 KB, 2026-02-03)

## 2. Issues & Conflicts

### ⚠️ Critical Findings

- **Missing Architecture**: Without a technical architecture, we cannot validate the system's ability to support the reported Functional and Non-Functional Requirements.
- **Missing Epics & Stories**: We cannot validate requirement coverage or sprint sequencing without the itemized implementation plan (Epics).

### 🔄 Conflict Resolution

- No duplicate documents found.

---

## 3. Recommended Actions

- **Proceed with PRD Audit ONLY**: We can perform an adversarial review of the PRD in isolation to find gaps, but full "Readiness" cannot be certified without Architecture and Epics.
- **Run `/create-architecture`**: To fill the technical gap.
- **Run `/create-epics-and-stories`**: To fill the execution gap.
