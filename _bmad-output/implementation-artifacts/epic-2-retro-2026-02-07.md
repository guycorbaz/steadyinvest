# 🔄 Retrospective Report: Epic 2 - Kinetic SSG Visualization

**Date**: 2026-02-07
**Project**: naic
**Epic**: 2 (Kinetic SSG Visualization)

## 📊 Epic Summary

All stories for Epic 2 have been completed, delivering a high-performance logarithmic charting engine and a comprehensive Quality Dashboard. The project has successfully adopted the "Institutional HUD" design aesthetic.

### Delivery Metrics

- **Stories Completed**: 3 / 3 (100%)
- **Status**: ✅ Done
- **Velocity**: High (All stories delivered within the iteration)

## 👥 Participants

- **Bob (SM)**: Facilitator
- **Alice (PO)**: Product & Quality Alignment
- **Charlie (Dev)**: Architecture & Math Hardening
- **Elena (Dev)**: Component Implementation
- **Dana (QA)**: Risk-based Testing
- **Guy (Project Lead)**: Strategic Direction

---

## 🌟 What Went Well

- **WASM Performance**: The `charming` library integration provides sub-2s render times, meeting NFR1.
- **Math Integrity**: Best-fit linear regression on log-scale was hardened to handle non-positive value edge cases.
- **Design Consistency**: The custom SCSS and component-level styling successfully hit the "Institutional HUD" target.
- **Isolated Logic**: Centralizing financial formulas in `crates/naic-logic` made testing reliable and reuse simple.

## 🛠️ Challenges & Insights

### Documentation Gaps

- **Observation**: While the code is functional, internal documentation (Rust doc headers, CSS comments) has been inconsistent.
- **Root Cause**: High focus on mathematical accuracy and UI delivery led to documentation being seen as secondary.
- **Correction**: Establishing a "Documentation-First" policy.

### User Documentation

- **Observation**: As the tool becomes more powerful, users need clear guidance on how to interpret SSG charts and Quality Dashboards.
- **Action**: Initiating a user documentation project alongside the technical development of the next epic.

## 🚀 Epic 3 Preview: Tactical Valuation

Epic 3 will introduce **Kinetic Charting**—allowing users to drag trendlines to set growth projections.

- **Key Risks**: WASM feedback loop speed and complex browser interaction testing.
- **Prerequisites**: Ensure Epic 2 math logic is documented and stable.

## 📝 Action Items (SMART)

| Action Item | Owner | Category | Deadline | Success Criteria |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Enforce Doc Headers** | Charlie | Technical | Next Story | `cargo doc` returns 100% coverage for new code. |
| **CSS/HTML Comments** | Elena | Process | Next Story | All new style blocks have headers explaining intent. |
| **Initialize User Docs** | Paige | Documentation | End of E3 | A `docs/user/` directory exists with an Initial Guide. |
| **Drag-Event Prototypes** | Charlie | Technical | Story 3.1 | Real-time WASM signal latency confirmed <50ms. |
| **Automated Drag Tests** | Dana | QA | Story 3.1 | Playwright/Cypress tests simulate drag interactions. |

---

## ⚠️ Critical Path

1. **Apply Doc Policy**: Retroactive fix for Epic 2 core logic files before starting Story 3.1.
2. **Setup E3 Environment**: Initialize `KineticChart` signals in the frontend.

## 🏁 Conclusion

The team is proud of the "Institutional HUD" progress. We are moving into Epic 3 with a renewed focus on documentation and user-centricity.

**Bob (Scrum Master)**: "Meeting adjourned. Great work, everyone!"
