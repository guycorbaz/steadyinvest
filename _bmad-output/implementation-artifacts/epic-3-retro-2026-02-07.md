# 🔄 Retrospective Report: Epic 3 - Tactical Valuation

**Date**: 2026-02-07
**Project**: SteadyInvest
**Epic**: 3 (Tactical Valuation)

## 📊 Epic Summary

Epic 3 successfully delivered the most interactive part of the SteadyInvest analysis tool. Users can now intuitively project growth via draggable chart handles and maintain data integrity through a persistent manual override system. All 3 stories are complete.

### Delivery Metrics

- **Stories Completed**: 3 / 3 (100%)
- **Status**: ✅ Done
- **Velocity**: High (Kinetic handles and signals optimized for <50ms latency)

## 👥 Participants

- **Bob (SM)**: Facilitator
- **Alice (PO)**: Validation & Business Logic
- **Charlie (Dev)**: Math Hardening & JS Bridge
- **Dana (QA)**: E2E Interactive Testing
- **Guy (Project Lead)**: Strategic Approval

---

## 🌟 What Went Well

- **Kinetic Charting**: Dragging trendlines with real-time CAGR updates provides a premium, responsive feel.
- **Shared Logic**: `steady-invest-logic` now handles complex P/E range calculations (last 10 years limit) and projections with high precision.
- **Manual Overrides**: Implemented a robust Audit Trail system for financial data overrides.

---

## 🛠️ Challenges & Insights

- **Documentation Drift**: While math logic is well-documented with headers, the **user documentation** action from Epic 2 was not fully addressed.
- **ECharts Interactivity**: Achieving high-performance dragging required a custom JavaScript bridge from the Leptos (WASM) frontend.

## 🚀 Epic 4 Preview: Professional Reporting

Epic 4 focuses on "Locking" the thesis and generating professional exports.

- **Prerequisites**: Ensure the reporting service (`backend/src/services/reporting.rs`) is ready for PDF generation.
- **Action**: Carry over "Initialize User Docs" as a critical pre-start item for Epic 4.

## 📝 Action Items (SMART)

| Action Item | Owner | Category | Deadline | Success Criteria |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Initialize User Docs** | SM/PO | Documentation | Kickoff E4 | `docs/user/` exists with a basic navigation/SSG guide. |
| **Backend Reporting Setup** | Charlie | Technical | Story 4.2 | Reporting service successfully generates a test PDF. |
| **Snapshot Schema Update** | Charlie | Database | Story 4.1 | Schema supports full state snapshots for "Locked Analysis". |

---

## 🏁 Conclusion

Epic 3 marks a major milestone in making `steadyinvest` an interactive instrument rather than just a data viewer.

**Bob (Scrum Master)**: "Epic 3 closed. Great work everyone, specifically on the signal performance!"
